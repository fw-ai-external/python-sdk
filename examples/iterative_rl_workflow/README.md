- we do not split train/validation/test sets. We use the entire dataset for training. You should probably handle this level of data splitting in your own code
- we use direct route to minimize network latency and keepalive to save on job creation/teardonw time
- use cleanup.py to delete oprhaned trainer jobs that train.py does not delete
- you can increase --replica-count to increase throughput of your rollouts
